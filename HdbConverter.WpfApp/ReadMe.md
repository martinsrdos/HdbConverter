# HDB Converter

HDB Converter stands for Hexadecimal Decimal Binary Converter. That is, a converter between number systems.

## Story

The first version in winforms was created sometime in 2015, as my personal project for my work at the time, when I didn't enjoy using the Windows calculator to convert between systems. It handled the conversion well, but it was a lot of clicking.

Now, at my work is preparing to work on a client application in WPF (I hope the management will drop it and we will do it for the web), so I revived this micro project and converted it to WPF to get to know it a little.

## Description

The emphasis is on simplicity and ease of use. Therefore, the application can:
1. Close with Esc
2. Copy with Ctrl + C without having to select the text
3. Move with the arrows as if it were a three-line text field - i.e. the up/down arrow in the outer lines will cause the cursor to jump to the home/end position

## Still to be done:

1. Final publish as the application should be (version, manifest?, certificate?).
2. License - I don't know if it is necessary at all
3. Nicer, not native design
